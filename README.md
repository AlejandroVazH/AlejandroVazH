HELLO THERE,

I‚Äôm @AlejandroVazH. In my Github profile you may find projects relating:
- Data analysis :milky_way: (PCAs, classificator analysis, temporal sequence analysis -one o those is related with my Bachelor's Thesis-, ...)
- Data visualization and simulation :eyes: (dimensionality reduction techniques, visualization of data -mainly with matplotlib-, ...)
- Data simulation :hammer: (basically abstracting the properties of observed data and recreating more data with those)
Currently i'm working on projects relating simulation and representation of PDEs solutions üå©Ô∏è to satisfy my need of physics knowledge alongside computer science knowledge (if those already exist pls tell me so I update this file :ok_hand:)
